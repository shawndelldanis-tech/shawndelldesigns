Aka Nami Sushi Lounge: Restaurant Menu Design</h1>
    <p>This project involved creating a brand identity and full dine in menu for a fictional restaurant, I called it "Aka Nami Sushi Lounge". My design strikes a balance between modern elegance and luxury, featuring clean typography and a well structured layout. The assignment included a unique menu fold, specialty print finishes, and careful attention to both aesthetic and functional details. I also developed supporting brand elements, such as a business card and an additional branded item, to establish a cohesive visual system. The final deliverables were formatted for print and presented as a comprehensive branding package.</p>
